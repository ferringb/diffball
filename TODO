Command line hash_size is not always abided by, notable BUCKET/RBUCKET- will 
be fixed in the next release.

remove CommandBuffer.default_(add,copy)_src.  It's a kludge.

Fix patch support for xdelta delta -0 file1 file2 patch; bzip2 -vk9 patch; patcher file1 patch test
It seems to think the uncompressed length is less then what it is.

read_seq_write_rand currently doesn't handle overlay srcs incredibly well.  Actually, overlay srcs have issues.
Supporting all off the desired features, while keeping things flexible enough to incoporate overlay formats is proving tricky.

reconstruction via multiple patches- framework is being laid, but using another commandbuffer as a src for another commandbuffer needs 
finishing.

Aside from that, if  you've found weird behavior, email a bug
report to me at bdharring@wisc.edu .
