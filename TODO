A very general (and likely quite off) intended schedule for versions (and work 
that needs completion prior to hitting said version)...
That said and done, I need to re-order this to match reality, certain version 
mile-stones I've almost finished prior to finishing the interceding milestone 
work.

0.4			Oct/Nov 2003.
DONE	* option code in diffball, patcher, differ, and convert_delta
DONE	* function that is format aware, handles magic sig's.
DONE	* seperate my modifications of gdiff format into v5, and enable a 
	  specific v4 spec.
DONE	* md5 support in cfile- basically flag the cfile at opening, add func 
	  for finalizing/retrieving md5.  Refactor cfile (buffering system) 
	  for compression support to be added.
DONE	* code cleanup.  EG, add extern global verbosity option for control of
	  printf statements, start adding better definitions throughout code 
	  for compilation (eg via compile flags/options disabling certain 
	  sections of code).
DONE	* code a solution for handling md5's in file format- basically 
	  handle the goofy nature of some formats (bdelta's lack of a complete 
	  set of reconstruction commands for instance).  Enable checking of 
	  md5's if they're included in file (xdelta format).
	* Actually *use* the md5 solution from above.
STARTED	* start enabling checking of returned values.  Basically start cleaning
	  out the use of abort's and exit's, and use appropriate return values.
DONE	* relevant man pages
DONE	* have a basic (not necessarily cleanest/best) gzip compressor setup so 
	  compressed xdelta can be handled.
STARTED	* add a set of functions for pulling add len/offset pairs for formats
	  reasoning being, make it a default function so I can move optimizing
	  multiple adds (from diffball) into a single add command in the format
	  encoding.
	* standardize/fix the hash_size, do it in terms of elements or actual 
	  memory size?  thinking memory size, since MOD_HASH is 4 bytes each 
	  element, while CMOD_HASH is 8 bytes...
DONE	* abstract dcbuffer to support different types of add/copies sets-
	  ex: bsdiff has technically two add commands, and a copy-
	  basically it's copy overlay, along w/ standard add.
	  Bit of a kludge, needs to be generalized a bit, since it only supports 
	  2 add srcs currently.
DONE	* bsdiff support (hokay, so I got ambitious)
DONE	* multipass support
DONE	* verified hash.  Basically, scan the version file for chksum's 
	  needed, then scan the reference file for said chksum's.  Doing 
	  this allows for a hash entry to be verified, eg mark it such 
	  that these two chksum's match.  Way of cutting down on bad 
	  matches/worthless seeks.

0.50			Dec 2003
STARTED	* write *GOOD* man pages (eye of the beholder?)
DONE	* DCBuffer should be a general struct, with different ways of 
	  storing entries.  Full for patching/conversion, matches for
	  standard differencing (difference is it eliminates storing 
	  add's in memory, saving memory), llmatches for 
	  multipass/insert support.  llmatches is a linked list variant 
	  of the matches struct.
	* add patch info functions, for polling info on existant patches.
	  possibly a new binary, although might be overkill.
STARTED	* bsdiff support, possibly included into 0.4.
	* xdelta write support- could do it as of pre-0.4, although md5 support
	  is needed, and the lovely serialsource memory allocation problem- 
	  basically the unknown 8 bytes sandwiched between add data and control
	  block.  Contact bdharring at wisc.edu if anyone has ideas/better 
	  solution for the serialsource stored memory requirement.
	  No clue why the hell that is stored there let alone if that's what 
	  it is...
	* check into, and support if viable, past xdelta formats.
	  likely the serialsource issue listed above is going to be 
	  problematic- I'm betting that had a hand in the breaking of backwards
	  compatability in xdelta...
STARTED	* optimizations of buffering system.  Do something about the 
	  duplication of buffered data between cfile and differencing alg.
DONE	* Possibly a 'cfileExposeBuffer' type command, that returns a const 
	  unsigned char * to the internal cfile buffer.
STARTED	* refactor memalias for differing alg.  Basically adjustment of 
	  returned values, although exposeBuffer (above) might solve this.
	  I don't like the buffer window into a buffer.  Pointless...
DONE	* have working compression support in cfile.  Not saying it be'll 
	  great, just saying have it working.

0.60			Dec 2003/Feb 2004
	* add a correcting one pass differencing alg.
	  This would be good for backup solutions, differencing in one pass.
	  If you want this, contact me and I'll be a bit more expedient about it, 
	  otherwise I'll write it when I find a need/time.
	* possibly add flag to correcting algs, to flag correcting support 
	  on/off (correcting basically allows for correction (duh))- although 
	  correcting does slow things down (maybe not by much), possibly give 
	  them (user/dev) the option?

0.80			March 2004
STARTED	* gnudiff support working, for both recursive and  non-recursive patch.
	* possibly adjust formats (encoding/decoding) such that they are 
	  multiple functions... eg, attempt to make it such that the needed 
	  command space (CommandBuffer) can be optimized down, so that it 
	  doesn't require the entire set of delta commands to be stored in mem.
	* suffix based alg.

0.90			June 2004
	* assuming good design/api, this won't be hard, but begin *initial*
	  creation of a library api.  Subject to change obviously by 1.00, but
	  have something fairly concrete ready to roll.
STARTED	* optimize existing formats, differencing algs, buffering system.
STARTED	* reiterating, *OPTIMIZE BUFFERING SYSTEM*.
	* dev version of vcdiff.

1.00			July 2004
	* enter into a full production release.
	* locked down library api (obviously).

1.0x			Post July 2004
	* whatever optimizations/bug fixes needed.

Tentative versioning and time release obviously...
Dang crystal ball...
