Header format?
4 byte magic, 1 byte file format version? (256 versions)
reference md5 (32 bytes), patch md5 (nother 32 bytes).
possibly md5 the final rather then reference, since final is already accessed in a one-pass method... 
reference on the other hand is random access.
GDIFF encoding finished... need to rewrite portions of patcher.c to handle multiple encodings (determined by files magic)
interested note, while using total offset for offset encoding results in a larger uncompressed delta, when 
you bzip2 compress it you achieve the smallest delta so far.  even over offseting based on dc_pos.
