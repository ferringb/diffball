Header format?
4 byte magic, 1 byte file format version? (256 versions)
reference md5 (32 bytes), patch md5 (nother 32 bytes).
possibly md5 the final rather then reference, since final is already accessed in a one-pass method... 
reference on the other hand is random access.
Finish gdiff encoding- eg split off standard v4, then my tweaks w/ appropriate headers.
Seperate the differencing and encoding functions fully (eg move the final encoding call out of diff-algs).  Also, possibly 
create a control struct for differencing- abstract it, allow for it to stop part way if say dcbuffer gets filled.
Yeah, dcbuffer needs finishing too.  Cfile also needs compression added in....
