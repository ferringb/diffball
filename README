diffball is a general purpose delta compression/binary differencing 
suite.  As of 0.4, it currently supports the follow formats

---FORMATS---

Format		Read		Encode	Conversion
bdiff		yes	yes	yes
bdelta		yes	yes	yes, although not guranteed the 
				resultant delta will be processable by 
				bpatch.
gdiff v4	yes	yes	yes
gdiff v4
  (tweaked)	yes	yes	yes
switching	yes	yes	yes
unified diff	yes*	no	beta, but yes.
				*only non-recursive patches.
xdelta-1.1.0	yes	no	yes

---BINARIES---

differ 		general purpose differencing program, 
diffball 	specific implementation for processing tarball's (producing 
		smaller deltas then differ typically does for a 
		tarball)
patcher		reconstruction program, if a format has read support 
		patcher can reconstruct the target file.
convert_delta	program for converting between formats, if write support 
		is supported for the target format, and read support for 
		the source, it can convert between the two producing a 
		correct patch.  Caveat is bdelta's format, due to it 
		storing file size information in it.

-----SETUP-----

To configure and install diffball, first run the 'configure' script 
which will create a makefile along w/ a config.h appropriate to how you 
wanted it configured.  From there, just type "make".


-----BUGS------

report to me at bdharring@wisc.edu .
