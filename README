diffball is a general purpose delta compression/binary differencing 
suite.  As of 0.4, it currently supports the follow formats

---FORMATS---

Format		Read		Encode	Conversion
bdiff		yes	yes	yes
bdelta		yes	yes	yes, as of bdelta-0.1
gdiff v4	yes	yes	yes
gdiff v4
  (tweaked)	yes	yes	yes
switching	yes	yes	yes
unified diff	yes*	no	beta, but yes.  Normally disabled.
				*only non-recursive patches.
xdelta-1.1.0	yes	no	yes

---BINARIES---

differ 		general purpose differencing program, 
diffball 	specific implementation for processing tarball's- usually this
		results in a smaller delta then differ, w/ a better run-time.
		Differ does pull ahead for tarballs in some cases, notably 
		the evolution src tarballs.
patcher		reconstruction program, if a format has read support 
		patcher can reconstruct the target file.
convert_delta	program for converting between formats, if write support 
		is supported for the target format, and read support for 
		the source, it can convert between the two producing a 
		correct patch.

-----SETUP-----

To configure and install diffball, first run the 'configure' script 
which will create a makefile along w/ a config.h appropriate to how you 
wanted it configured and your system.  From there, just type "make".


-----BUGS------

Appears not to compile on OSX, although I think that may be do weirdness in 
tracking down needed libs/headers from fink (popt as an example).
Will be fixed either when a patch is sent in, or by 0.4 stable release.

Command line hash_size is not always abided by, notable BUCKET/RBUCKET- will 
be fixed in the next release (current being 0.4_pre4).

Aside from that, if  you've found weird behavior, email a bug 
report to me at bdharring@wisc.edu .
