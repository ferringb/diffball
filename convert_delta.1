.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
.nf

-V, --version                   output version, and exit
-v, --verbose                   increase verbosity
-c, --to-stdout                 output to-file to stdout
-j, --bzip2-compress            compress the to-file w/ bzip2
-z, --gzip-compress             compress the to-file w/ gzip
-s, --src-format FORMAT         used to override the auto
                                identification of a patch's format\&.
                                Valid formats are-
                                bdelta, gdiff4, gdiff5 (a nonstandard 
                                modification to gdiff4), bdiff, xdelta
                                and switching\&.
                                This option is not normally needed, 
                                since patcher can identify a patch's
                                format automatically if it is 
                                supported\&.
-t, --trg-format FORMAT         Used to specify the new patch's desired
                                format.
                                Valid formats are-
                                bdelta, gdiff4, gdiff5 (a nonstandard 
                                modification to gdiff4), bdiff, and
                                switching\&.
-m, --ignore-md5                if the patch's format supports md5's,
                                disables their use\&.  If the desired 
                                format doesn't support md5, this option
                                is ignored\&.
