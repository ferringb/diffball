As for the differencing alg, Randal Burns and Andrew Tridgell- I pulled the 
concept's/algorithm out of their papers (Tridgell for background, Burns for 
alg description).

Burn's 'Delta Compression on Unstructured Data' would be a good place to start 
for anyone curious about delta compression.  I've made modifications here and 
there to attempt and coax better performance, but by and by the underlying alg 
I learned from Burn's (and his associates of course) paper.
