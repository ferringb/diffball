For information on the differencing algs in use, Randal Burns and Andrew 
Tridgell would be a good place to start- I pulled the concept's/algorithm 
out of their papers (Tridgell for background, Burns for alg description).

Burn's 'Delta Compression on Unstructured Data' would be a good place to start 
for anyone curious about delta compression.  I've made modifications here and 
there to attempt and coax better performance, but by and by the underlying alg 
I learned from Burn's (and his associates of course) paper.
