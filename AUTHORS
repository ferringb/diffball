The variation on the adler32 (which was created by Marc Adler) I haven't seen elsewhere- I introduced the parity/prime array 
due to the fact I'm hashing only 16 chars, and standard adler32 seems to have problems w/ the limited of a dataset.

As for the differencing alg, Randal Burns and Andrew Tridgell- I pulled the concept's/algorithm out of their papers (Tridgell 
for background, Burns for alg description).

Burn's 'Delta Compression on Unstructured Data' would be a good place to start for anyone curious about delta compression.
I've made modifications here and there to attempt and coax better performance, but by and by the underlying alg I learned 
from Burn's (and his associates of course) paper.
