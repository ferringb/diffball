Marc Adler, Randal Burns, and Andrew Tridgell deserve credit for basically the 
algorithms- the adler32 rolling hash is based on Adler's implementation/alg, 
tridgell for his master thesis (which basically brought me up to speed on the 
lovely subject), and burns for the algorithm- it's one half pass correcting algoritm,
detailed in his paper on delta compression on unstructured data.
